Q6.Describe the purpose and usage of the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs in web development. Give
suitable examples for each.

The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs are part of the Web Storage API in web development. They allow developers to store key-value pairs locally in the user's browser, providing a way to persistently or temporarily store data across browser sessions.

1.localStorage API:

Purpose: The localStorage API is used to store data with no expiration date, meaning the data will persist even after the browser window is closed and reopened.
Usage: You can use the localStorage API to store user preferences, settings, user-generated content, or any data that needs to be retained across browser sessions.
Example: Storing User Preferences
// Storing user preferences in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');
localStorage.setItem('language', 'en');

// Retrieving user preferences from localStorage
const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
const language = localStorage.getItem('language');

console.log('Theme:', theme); // Output: Theme: dark
console.log('Language:', language); // Output: Language: en

2.sessionStorage API:

Purpose: The sessionStorage API is used to store data for a single browser session. The data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.
Usage: You can use the sessionStorage API to store temporary data, session-specific data, or data that is only needed during the current browser session.
Example: Storing Session-specific Data

// Storing session-specific data in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
sessionStorage.setItem('isLoggedIn', 'true');

// Retrieving session-specific data from sessionStorage
const username = sessionStorage.getItem('username');
const isLoggedIn = sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggedIn');

console.log('Username:', username); // Output: Username: JohnDoe
console.log('IsLoggedIn:', isLoggedIn); // Output: IsLoggedIn: true

In both examples, we use the setItem method to store key-value pairs (setItem(key, value)) and the getItem method to retrieve the stored values (getItem(key)). Both localStorage and sessionStorage provide similar methods for setting, getting, and removing items (removeItem(key)).
