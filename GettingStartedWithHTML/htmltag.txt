1.What is a DOCTYPE declaration in HTML?

HTML  <!DOCTYPE > is not a tag/element, it is just an instruction to the browser about the document type. It is a null element which does not contain the closing tag, and must not include any content within it.It is called the document type declaration (DTD).
The DOCTYPE in HTML5 is written to enable the standard method of writing. It is case insensitive, i.e., it can be written as <!Doctype HTML>, <!DOCTYPE html> etc. It should be placed on the top of the HTML document.

2.Write a short note on tag and element with an example?

TAG: HTML tags are like keywords which define how a web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. 
HTML tags contain three main parts: 
1. Opening tag
2.  Content
3.  Closing tag. 
But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.
Syntax:
<tag> content </tag>
Example of tags are <h1></h1> , <p></p> , <div></div> etc

Element: An element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.
An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and defining content in that webpage.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>WebPage</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- á¹¬his is the example of Element -->
  <h1>This is my first web page</h1>
</body>
</html>

3. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example how to use comments in HTML documents?


HTML comments are visible to anyone that views the page source code, but are not rendered when the HTML document is rendered by a browser.
We can use comments to explain our code, which can help us when we edit the source code at a later date.
HTML comments are enclosed in <!--     - -> this tag.

Below is an example of HTML comments:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Comments in HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- This is the example of how comments used in HTML -->
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
