    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>In this section, I'll be exploring the world of web design, covering topics like UI/UX, typography, and visual
      aesthetics.</p>

    <h2>User Interface (UI) Design</h2>
    <p>UI design focuses on the visual aspects of a website or application. It involves creating user-friendly and
      aesthetically pleasing interfaces. UI designers work on layout, color schemes, buttons, icons, and overall look
      and feel.</p>

    <h2>User Experience (UX) Design</h2>
    <p>UX design is concerned with the overall user experience. It involves understanding user behavior and designing
      interfaces that are intuitive and easy to navigate. UX designers conduct user research, create wireframes, and
      conduct usability testing.</p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>Typography plays a crucial role in web design. It involves choosing the right fonts, font sizes, and spacing to
      enhance readability and convey the desired brand personality. Good typography can greatly improve the overall
      design.</p>

    <h2>Visual Elements</h2>
    <p>Web designers use visual elements such as images, graphics, and icons to enhance the visual appeal of a website.
      They must consider factors like image quality, file formats, and placement for an effective design.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>With the increasing use of various devices and screen sizes, responsive design is essential. Web designers ensure
      that websites adapt to different screens, providing a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
    </p>

    <h2>Color Theory</h2>
    <p>Color choices can significantly impact a website's design. Designers study color theory to create harmonious and
      visually pleasing color palettes. They also consider color psychology to evoke specific emotions in users.</p>

    <h2>Web Design Tools</h2>
    <p>Web designers use a variety of tools and software, such as Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma, and Photoshop, to create and
      prototype designs. These tools help streamline the design process.</p>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Web designers should prioritize accessibility, ensuring that websites are usable by individuals with
      disabilities. This includes providing alternative text for images, ensuring proper contrast, and following
      accessibility guidelines.</p>
