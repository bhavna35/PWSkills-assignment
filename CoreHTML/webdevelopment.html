    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>In this section, I'll be discussing various aspects of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
      more.</p>
    <h2>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
    <p>HTML is the foundation of web development. It's used for structuring web content and creating the basic layout of
      web pages. HTML elements define the structure of a page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and
      more.</p>

    <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
    <p>CSS is used for styling web pages. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and visual aspects of your
      website. With CSS, you can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for adding interactivity to web pages. It enables features
      like form validation, animations, dynamic content updates, and handling user interactions. Many modern web
      applications are built using JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.</p>

    <h2>Front-End vs. Back-End Development</h2>
    <p>In web development, there's a distinction between front-end and back-end development. Front-end developers focus
      on creating the user interface and client-side functionality that users interact with directly. Back-end
      developers work on server-side logic, databases, and application infrastructure that support the front-end.</p>

    <h2>Frameworks and Libraries</h2>
    <p>Web developers often use frameworks and libraries to streamline development. Popular front-end frameworks include
      React, Angular, and Vue.js, while back-end frameworks like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and Django are commonly used to
      build server-side applications.</p>

    <h2>Version Control and Deployment</h2>
    <p>Version control systems like Git help developers manage code changes, collaborate with others, and track project
      history. Deployment involves making your web application or site accessible to users, typically through web
      hosting services.</p>
