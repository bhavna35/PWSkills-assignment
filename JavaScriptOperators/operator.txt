1.  Explain the usage of ternary operator with syntax.

Ternary operator is used to test the conditions similar to that of an if else block. It has three operands: condition,
statement if condition is true and statement if condition will be false.

Condition ? value if true : value if false;

2.  Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.
Solution: Comma operator allows us to evaluate multiple expressions in a single statement like declaring multiple
variables in a single statement separating them with the comma operator.

Example:
const a = 10, b = 20, c=30;
console.log(a+b+c);
