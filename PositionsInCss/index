1.  Explain the difference between absolute and relative positioning.

Relative Positioning:
Elements with position: relative are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow.
The element retains its space in the document flow, meaning it affects the layout of other elements as if it were still in its original position.
You can use top, right, bottom, and left properties to offset the element from its normal position. These values are relative to the element's original position.
Relative positioning is often used for fine-tuning the position of elements without disrupting the surrounding content.


Absolute Positioning:
Elements with position: absolute are positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor element with a position value other than static, such as relative, absolute, or fixed).
Absolute-positioned elements are removed from the document flow, and they do not affect the layout of other elements. This can lead to overlapping content if not managed correctly.
You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to position the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, rather than its original position in the document flow.
Absolute positioning is often used for creating overlays, pop-up menus, or elements that need to be precisely positioned in a specific location.
