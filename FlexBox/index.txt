1.  Describe the main difference between CSS flexbox layout model and CSS grid layout model. When would you choose to use one over the another. 

The main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model lies in how they control the layout and positioning of elements within a container.
Here are the key distinctions between the two, along with guidance on when to choose one over the other:


CSS Flexbox:

One-Dimensional Layout: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column. It's excellent for arranging items along a single axis, such as in a navigation menu or a list of items.
Dynamic Sizing: Flexbox allows items to expand or shrink based on available space and their content. It's ideal for situations where the size of the items may vary.
Content-Centered Alignment: It excels at centering items both horizontally and vertically within a container.
Order Control: You can easily change the order of items, which is useful for responsive design or reordering content.


CSS Grid:

Two-Dimensional Layout: Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts. It allows you to create rows and columns, making it perfect for complex layouts like grids of images or articles.
Fixed or Responsive Sizing: Grid provides more control over fixed or responsive sizing of rows and columns. You can specify exact dimensions or let content determine the size.
Grid Gaps: You can add gaps between rows and columns with ease, creating a structured grid with consistent spacing.
Item Placement: Grid allows you to precisely position items within the grid cells. You can place items anywhere in the grid, making it great for intricate designs.

When to Choose Flexbox:

Use Flexbox when dealing with one-dimensional layouts, like navigation menus, sidebars, or arranging elements within a single container.
Flexbox is great for content-centered alignment, such as vertically aligning items within a container.
When the order of items needs to change for responsive design without altering the HTML structure.

When to Choose Grid:

Choose Grid when you need to create complex two-dimensional layouts, such as grids of images, cards, or articles.
Grid is ideal when you want fine-grained control over rows, columns, and gaps in your layout.
When you need to precisely position items within a grid, and it's important to control where each element goes within a defined grid structure.




2.  Explain the role of following key propeerties in flexbox layout model.
a.  justify-content
b.  align-items
c.  align-content
d.  flex-direction
e.  flex-wrap


justify-content: This property controls how items are distributed along the main axis (horizontally, in the case of flex-direction: row). Values can include flex-start (default), flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around, among others.

align-items: This property controls how items are aligned on the cross-axis (vertically, in the case of flex-direction: row). Values include flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch.

align-content: This property is used to control how multiple lines of items are aligned on the cross-axis. It works when there is extra space within the flex container. Values can include flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around, similar to justify-content.

flex-direction: This property sets the direction of the main axis. It can be row (default), row-reverse, column, or column-reverse.

flex-wrap: This property controls whether flex items should wrap onto a new line when they don't fit on the main axis. Values include nowrap (default), wrap, and wrap-reverse

gap:  The gap property is used to specify the gap between flex items in a flex container.
It works only along the main axis (either horizontally or vertically) depending on the flex-direction property.
